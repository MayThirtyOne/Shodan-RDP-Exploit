# Shodan-RDP-Exploit
Discovering and exploiting remote hosts running vulnerable versions of Windows distributions

# Description 
Usually, Windows KVM Virtualization is not supported on several cloud platforms like Digitalocean, OVH, Linode, etc. But some users found a workaround this restriction by booting an unsecured version of Windows distros available at places like WhatUpTime.com. The only problem being, they use a redundant weak password for all their machines. I collected a list of vulnerable machines via the search API at shodan and brute-forced them with the default password. The results were great. I quickly shared my findings with Digitalocean and they took down those machines.
